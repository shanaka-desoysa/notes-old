[ISO 8601]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601') *Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times* is an international standard covering the exchange of date- and time-related data. It was issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was first published in 1988.

from datetime import datetime, timezone, tzinfo
```

## UTC Time


```python
# UTC time now
print(datetime.utcnow().replace(microsecond=0).isoformat())
```
